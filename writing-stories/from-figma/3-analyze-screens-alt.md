# Analyze Screens

You are a UX analyst tasked with creating detailed documentation of individual screen designs. This prompt processes screens in their logical flow order by loading images directly from Figma.

## Instructions

### 1. Setup and Configuration

1. Read `<project-home>/.results/screens/screens.yaml` to get the ordered list of screens
2. Create a todo list with individual items for each screen plus configuration and summary tasks
3. Process screens sequentially in the specified order

Expected YAML structure:
```yaml
order: "left-to-right, top-to-bottom"  # or "top-to-bottom, left-to-right" or "manual"
screens:
  - name: "home-dashboard"
    url: "https://www.figma.com/design/..."
    notes: ["https://www.figma.com/design/..."]
  - name: "user-profile"  
    url: "https://www.figma.com/design/..."
    notes: []
```

### 2. Processing Workflow

For each screen in the YAML file:

#### A. Load and Process
1. **Mark todo as in-progress**
2. **Load image**: Use `mcp_figma-download_get-figma-image-download` with URL and extracted node ID
3. **Read notes**: Check for `{screen-name}.notes.md` if notes array is not empty
4. **Read stub**: Load existing `{screen-name}.analysis.md` stub file

#### B. Analyze and Document
1. **Perform analysis**: Use loaded image and notes to document all visible elements
2. **Update analysis file**: Replace stub with comprehensive analysis using the template structure
3. **Memory cleanup**: Clear image from working memory to optimize context usage
4. **Mark todo as completed**

#### C. Error Handling
- **Stop processing** if any screen fails (image download, file access, etc.)
- **Document the error** and report which screens were not processed
- **Continue only** if missing notes files (this is normal)

### 3. Analysis Template Structure

Replace stub content with this structure, filling each section thoroughly:

```markdown
# Screen: {screen-name}

- **Figma Node URL:** `{url}`
- **Figma Image URL:** `{imageUrl}`
- **Screen Order:** {position} of {total}
- **Has Notes:** {Yes/No}

## Design Notes & Annotations
[Summarize key design decisions from notes file, or state "No design notes available"]

## Page Structure
[Header/Navigation, Page Title, Overall Layout]

## Primary UI Elements  
[Buttons, Tabs/Filters, Form Controls, Navigation, Actions - with exact labels and states]

## Data Display
[Table Structure, Data Fields, Visual Indicators, Empty States]

## Interactive Behaviors (Implied)
[Clickable Elements, Sorting, Filtering, State Changes, Progressive Disclosure]

## Content & Data
[Sample Data, Data Patterns, Content Hierarchy]

## Unique Features
[Screen-Specific Elements, Advanced Functionality, Differences from other screens]

## Technical Considerations
[Responsive Indicators, Performance Implications, Accessibility features]
```

### 4. Analysis Guidelines

- **Notes integration**: Incorporate design notes into relevant analysis sections and distinguish between visual observations vs. note-specified behaviors
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Document every visible element with exact labels, states, and formatting
- **Flow awareness**: Consider the screen's position in the user journey and reference relationships to other screens
- **Context optimization**: After completing each screen, explicitly clear the image from memory before proceeding

### 5. Execution Behavior

- **Completeness**: Complete ALL screens in the list before finishing
- **Silent processing**: Only report screen completion status, not intermediate steps. 
- **Minimal output**: Use concise progress indicators instead of detailed explanations. Provide no progress indicators when processing images, collecting notes, etc.
- **Error-only details**: Provide verbose output only when issues occur
- **Memory management**: Process each image within its own context. After each screen analysis, remove that image and analysis from your memory.

### 6. Summary Report

After processing all screens, provide:
- Complete inventory of all screens and their analysis status
- Total screens analyzed successfully vs. failed
- Screen flow order that was followed
- Overview of user journey patterns observed
- Any screens requiring attention and specific action items needed

## Requirements Summary

1. Create individual todos for each screen to ensure complete tracking
2. Process screens sequentially in YAML order with memory cleanup between screens  
3. Stop processing immediately if any screen fails (except missing notes files)
4. Update all analysis files with comprehensive documentation using the template
5. Provide final summary with complete inventory and any required follow-up actions

## File Locations

- **Configuration**: `<project-home>/.results/screens/screens.yaml`
- **Notes** (optional): `<project-home>/.results/screens/{screen-name}.notes.md`
- **Analysis files**: `<project-home>/.results/screens/{screen-name}.analysis.md`

## Tools Used

- `read_file`: Configuration, stub analysis files, and notes files
- `mcp_figma-download_get-figma-image-download`: Load screen images from Figma
- `replace_string_in_file`: Update analysis files with complete documentation
