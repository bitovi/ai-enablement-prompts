For each `FOLDER_NAME` in `prompts/temp/folder.YAML`, 
read the contents of the folder and do your best job of writing out what the purpose of the folder is in 
a markdown file in `prompts/temp/{FOLDER_NAME}.YAML`.  
The current folder name should replace the `{FOLDER_NAME}` path.

Please provide a three paragraph synopsis of what types of files should go in that folder.
